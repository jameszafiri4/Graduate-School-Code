    <h1 id="header">This is a first level header</h1>
    <p>This is a common paragraph, only extremely longer than it need to be.
      It is not to boring you reading it, just to be able to show you that the
      line break has not to do in the source and in the rendered web page.
      You can try to reshape your browser and see how it rewrap your paragraph.
      In fact, the only part that remains breaking is the breaking line command
      (br) of the markup language. <br> This is after the line break.
    </p>
    <h2>This is a second level header</h2>
    <p>This is a first paragraph below the second header.
      Which is also extended to try to make a implicit line break.</p>
    <p>This is the second paragraph within the second level header.</p>
